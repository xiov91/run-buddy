# Run Buddy

![screenshot](rb_screenshot.png)
 
  ## Description
  Our first project in our Full Stack course. This was solely a foray into the front-end, including forms, CSS, and multiple HTML pages. Though I didn't know it at the time, it was also our first experience in responsiveness and mobile-first design.

  # Installation/Usage
  There's no installation required here. The back-end was nonexistant by design, so there's no hookup to the forms that were made. However, you can view the deployed app [here](https://xiov91.github.io/run-buddy/)
